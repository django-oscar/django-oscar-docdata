Version 1.3.2 (2019-03-14)

--------------------------

* Upgraded to Docdata 1.3 API
* Removed the untested and probably unused `start` method from the `DocdataClient` class
* Removed the corresponding start_payment method from the `Interface` class

Version 1.2.12 (2019-02-06)

Version 1.2.11 (2018-03-07)
---------------------------

* Added Python 3 support.

Version 1.2.10
--------------

* Fixed Django 1.9+ support in templates.

Version 1.2.9
-------------

* Fixed the ``default`` value of the ``merchant_name`` field in the migrations.

Version 1.2.8
-------------

* Fixed Django 1.10 deprecation warnings

Version 1.2.7
-------------

* Added django-polymorphic 0.8 support

Version 1.2.6
-------------

* Added Django 1.7 migrations

Version 1.2.5
-------------

* Cache Docdata WSDL information, avoid fetching it each time ``Facade``/``Interface``/``DocdataClient`` object is constructed.
* Added ``DocdataClient.set_merchant(name, password)`` method.
* Added subaccount support

 * Added ``merchant_name`` parameter to ``create_payment()``.
 * Fill ``DOCDATA_MERCHANT_PASSWORDS`` to support updating/cancelling orders created at other subaccounts.
 * Minor **backwards incompatibility**: ``start_payment()`` "order_key" parameter is renamed to "order".
   This only affects passing kwargs. Passing the order key works but is deprecated, pass a ``DocdataOrder`` instead.

* Added ``update_docdata_order`` management command.
* Added ``-v3`` flag for managements commands to displays the SOAP XML conversation (via logging).
* Allow ``return_view_called`` signal handlers to return a response, thereby overriding the default response.
* Increased ``DOCDATA_PAYMENT_SUCCESS_MARGIN`` for USD to $1.50
* Fix reverting order statuses, using ``Order.set_status()`` now so manually changed order statuses are not reversed.
* Fix detecting "paid" status when the customer starts multiple payment attempts, but then completes the first.
  (the root issue here is the lack of a missing global "cluster/order status" field in the API - so we have to make guesses).
* Fix handling of paid orders that have a partial refund (e.g. 5%).
* Fix handling of orders with received a chargeback.
* Fix using ``%s`` in logging statements so Sentry can group similar events.
* Fix ``DocdataOrder.last_payment`` property.

Version 1.2.4
-------------

* Added support for multiple merchant accounts in a single database (multi-tenant support).
* Added manager methods to ``DocdataOrder.objects``: ``current_merchant()``, ``for_reference()``, ``for_order()``.
* Added support for the parameters ``billing_address``, ``shipping_address``, ``basket`` in the `get_create_payment_args()` code.
* Added support for the ``Invoice`` element. This is needed to pass state for PayPal.
* Added ``DOCDATA_FACADE_CLASS`` setting, so all views use a custom Facade
* Added ``DOCDATA_HOUSE_NUMBER_FIELD`` setting.
* Added ``oscar_docdata.gateway.to_iso639_part1()`` function, for sending language codes in the proper format.
* Added pagination in docdata dashboard view.
* Using suds-jurko_ fork for SOAP calls, which is a maintained fork of suds_.
* Fix detecting expired orders via the status API.
* Improve ``/api/docdata/update/`` output for curl usage.
